## Overview

Rust royal is a Battle Royal with the playstyle of rust. Instead of looting for guns like in normal BRs, the player loots components and farms materials to craft the guns, meds, and gear. There is an increased rate of gathering, faster smelting, and instant crafting. The Maps are designed to not have safe zones or scientists and is optimized for performance. All hight tier loot creates will spawn inside the puzzle room which will require the players to get a green, blue, or red card with a fuse to assess the puzzle rooms. Unlike other BRs when the player dies they are not able to spawn. But in Rust Royal, you can spawn on the beach, bag, or bed. If the zone comes in contact with the bag or bed then the spawn is deactivated and the player will not be able to spawn. Last team alive wins.
