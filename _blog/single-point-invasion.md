## Overview

Single Point Invasion (SPI) is a Squad mod that is an enhanced version of the game mode invasion. This mod takes all of the best features of Invasion and condenses it into a compact game mode.

Instead of attacking multiple points sequentially like in Invasion, the teams attack and defend a single point. There is also an extended staging period where each team can build FOBs and plan out their attack/defense.

Once the staging phase ends all hell breaks loose.
